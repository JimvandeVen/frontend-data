# frontend-data
## Introduction
In this project I am working together with the Openbare Bibliotheek Amsterdam(OBA). I am using data that was scraped by [maanlamp](https://github.com/maanlamp). In his connection with the dataset he was able to take aproximately 5000 books.

## My concept
In the drawing below you can see what my early concept is of my data visualisation. I have to first learn about d3 before I make too many assumptions in the design. Even so, this is roughly my vision in the design. I am still debating about foreign books.

After seeing the project of [Leon van Zijl](https://github.com/LeonvanZijl/fe3-assessment-3) I decided the best way forward was to get to know mapbox.
